<h1>Motivation:</h1>
watch the video below, to understand why CRT tvs using rca cable is the best way to play mega drive (genesis) games.

its quite hard to reproduce this effect on an lcd screen, even with shaders, its quite hard to find the corret filter, and the filter may not have the desired appearence when we move to other technologies such as led.

playing on real hardware is an temporary solution, but not everyone has an megadrive/genesis, old consoles break over time, not everyone know how to fix then (or can afford) and some units may be FUBAR.
some talented developers may be able to develop an perfect shader but not everyone is aware of this issue, not everyone who is, is capable of developing such shaders and
even enthusiasts who are willing to try to tackle this problem may strugle to have acess to the old hardware (the price tend to only rise over the years)
maybe this solution can produce the same effect as an  short time solution before we make an perfect shader.
as long as an developer still have an CRT tv to compare with his shader.
